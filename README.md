# Movie-Recommendation-System
In this project, I developed a movie recommendation system leveraging data from two CSV files containing information about movies and their credits. Initially, I merged the datasets and selected relevant columns for analysis, such as movie titles, overviews, genres, keywords, cast, and crew. Subsequently, I performed extensive data preprocessing, converting string representations of lists to actual lists, tokenizing and cleaning text data, and combining relevant tags into a unified column. Following this, I employed text vectorization techniques to convert textual data into numerical vectors, enabling similarity computations. Additionally, I implemented stemming to reduce words to their root forms, facilitating better comparisons. Using cosine similarity, I calculated the similarity between movie vectors, establishing a basis for recommendation. Finally, I developed a recommendation function that, given a movie title, identifies similar movies based on their tags and prints the top recommendations. This project showcases the implementation of a movie recommendation system capable of providing personalized suggestions, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction in the realm of movie watching.
